abstract = {A novel method for detection of noble-metal nanoparticles by their nonlinear optical properties is presented and applied for specific labeling of cellular organelles. When illuminated by laser light in resonance with their plasmon frequency these nanoparticles generate an enhanced multiphoton signal. This enhanced signal is measured to obtain a depth-resolved image in a laser scanning microscope setup. Plasmon-resonance images of both live and fixed cells, showing specific labeling of cellular organelles and membranes, either by two-photon autofluorescence or by third-harmonic generation, are presented.},

abstract = {Holographic optical tweezers were used to show the interaction between a strongly focused laser beam and magnetic nanoparticles in ferrofluid. When the light intensity was high enough, magnetic nanoparticles were removed from the beam center and formed a dark ring. The same behavior was observed when focusing vortex or Bessel beams. The interactions between two or more separated rings of magnetic nanoparticles created by independent optical traps were also observed.},

                   cross-modality disentanglement",

  abstract      = "This paper presents a generic method for generating full
                   facial 3D animation from speech. Existing approaches to
                   audio-driven facial animation exhibit uncanny or static
                   upper face animation, fail to produce accurate and plausible
                   co-articulation or rely on person-specific models that limit
                   their scalability. To improve upon existing models, we
                   propose a generic audio-driven facial animation approach
                   that achieves highly realistic motion synthesis results for
                   the entire face. At the core of our approach is a
                   categorical latent space for facial animation that
                   disentangles audio-correlated and audio-uncorrelated
                   information based on a novel cross-modality loss. Our
                   approach ensures highly accurate lip motion, while also
                   synthesizing plausible animation of the parts of the face
                   that are uncorrelated to the audio signal, such as eye
                   blinks and eye brow motion. We demonstrate that our approach
                   outperforms several baselines and obtains state-of-the-art
                   quality both qualitatively and quantitatively. A perceptual
                   user study demonstrates that our approach is deemed more
                   realistic than the current state-of-the-art in over 75\% of
                   cases. We recommend watching the supplemental video before
